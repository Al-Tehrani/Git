# First Time Git Setup
Git comes with a tool called git config that lets you get and set configuration variables that control all aspects of how Git looks and operates. These variables can be stored in three different places:

- `/etc/gitconfig` file: Contains values for every user on the system and all their repositories. If you pass the option `--system` to `git config`, it reads and writes from this file specifically.
- `~/.gitconfig` or `~/.config/git/config` file: Specific to your user. You can make Git read and write to this file specifically by passing the `--global` option.
- `config` file in the Git directory (that is, `.git/config`) of whatever repository youâ€™re currently using: Specific to that single repository.

Each level overrides values in the previous level, so values in .`git/config` trump those in `/etc/gitconfig`.

**Note:** The path to git config file for each level of configuration may be slightly different on your system. To check the path to the config file for global level for example, run `git config --global --edit` and check the opened file path. The same applies for the other levels.
