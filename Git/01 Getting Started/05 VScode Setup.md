## Installation

### Windows, Linux, and MacOS
Visual Studio Code is free and available on your favorite platform - Linux, macOS, and Windows. Download it from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and install it on your machine.

### WSL
To use Visual Studio Code with the Windows Subsystem for Linux, please install Visual Studio Code in Windows and uninstall the Linux version in WSL. You can then use the code command in a WSL terminal just as you would in a normal command prompt.

## Extensions
There are literally thousands of extensions in the VS Code marketplace with new ones coming seemingly every single day! Extensions can serve many purposes. From extension-like UI themes to programming language support, debugging, Git integration, and even Spotify players! Extensions are very important because they make the VS Code what it currently is, a very capable piece of software. Without them, VS Code would be not much beyond glorified text editor with good design and basic autocompletion here and there.

Extensions are really important to customizing your software to suit your personal needs. So please use them!
